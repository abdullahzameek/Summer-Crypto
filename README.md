# LIGHT-
Side Channel Cryptanalysis on Lightweight Ciphers

This repository contains a few samples implementations of cryptographic ciphers.
The purpose of this repository is purely academic and exists with the intention to research these ciphers.
The ciphers chosen are lightweight ciphers, with the exception of DES which was picked as a sample implementation to test the waters.
